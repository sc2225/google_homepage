<p>Goal: Re-create the Google homepage (Link to cached page of the Google homepage given as a referenced: https://web.archive.org/web/20191130234759/https://www.google.com/) using HTML and CSS. The aim is to make it look like google.com and not worry about the functionality.</p>

<h3>What I learned from this project:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Basic HTML and CSS</li>
  <li>How to center elements horizontally on a page</li>
  <li>Building a basic navigation bar using lists and css styling</li>
  <li>How to incorporate images into an HTML page<li>

Note: My re-created Google homepage is missing the icons within the search bar and the 'apps' icon in the top navigation bar.
